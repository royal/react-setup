This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Getting Started

First, install the npm dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Once installed, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will build and run the application. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
